Starting from nothing but an existing alphabet was really intimidating. While doing further research I stumbled upon modular fonts whereby each letter or symbol is formed with the same shapes. This gave me a directon of how to start and to build my own font. Of course this made a font that is unusable for a continious text. <br> I later on chose to call it &#39;Arthrosis&#39; because while talking about it with some friends, someone reconised that all the modular elements kind of looked like bones and after looking again I couldn&#39;t unsee it. After I made the font I used it on a poster and it was used in an expo as title. </p></div><div><p class="font-medium text-base font-sans pb-0">MY FONT &amp; MODULAR ELEMENTS</p></div>',5),f={class:"flex place-content-center pb-1"},m=["src"],u=e("div",{class:"pb-3 leading-relaxed font-sans"},[e("p",null,"The font with in the right corner the 6 elements used to build each letter.")],-1),b=e("div",null,[e("p",{class:"font-medium text-base font-sans pb-0.5"},"IN USE")],-1),_={class:"flex place-content-center pb-1"},g=["src"],v=e("div",{class:"pb-6 leading-relaxed font-sans"},[e("p",null,"The font used on a poster and printed on a risoprinter.")],-1),x={class:"flex place-content-center pb-1"},w=["src"],y=e("div",{class:"pb-3 leading-relaxed font-sans"},[e("p",null,"The font used as title in an expo.")],-1),E={__name:"ArtroseView",setup(T){return(k,A)=>{const s=o("FooterComp");return a(),n("div",p,[h,e("div",f,[e("img",{src:t(l),alt:"Typefase with modular elements",class:"h-screen w-auto"},null,8,m)]),u,b,e("div",_,[e("img",{src:t(d),alt:"Typefase used on poster",class:"h-screen w-auto"},null,8,g)]),v,e("div",x,[e("img",{src:t(c),alt:"Typefase used in expo",class:"h-screen w-auto"},null,8,w)]),y,i(s)])}}};export{E as default};
