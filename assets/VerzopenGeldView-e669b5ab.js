Everyone can find something to their liking from trying to win a teddy bear to being shot meters in the air. But the one thing that in my opinion brings happiness and fun times to everyone is the LunaPark or arcade (I don&#39;t really know how else to describe it). </p></div><div><p class="leading-relaxed pb-3"> When I was making a bike ride I came across this fair in Diegem. I walked around for a bit and made photo&#39;s from which this small series came to be. It focusses on the arcade and more specifically the coinpushers you can find within it. <br> I decided to name the series &#39;Verzopen Geld&#39; which litteraly translates to &#39;Drowned Money&#39; because the whole coin pusher game is about money but you never win your money&#39;s worth. So apart from the joy of playing your money is drowned in the game and the masses playing the game. </p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2"><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+n+'" alt=""></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+r+'" alt=""></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full pt-0" src="'+d+'" alt=""></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full pt-0" src="'+l+'" alt=""></div></div>',5),u={__name:"VerzopenGeldView",setup(p){return(h,f)=>{const e=o("FooterComp");return s(),t("div",c,[m,a(e)])}}};export{u as default};
